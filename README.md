# BachelorThesis
This Repo contains the code and some descriptions of my Bachelorthesis in Algorithmic Trading with Machine Learning. 

This project was built over 9 months with ~20h per week and one hour of review session with my mentor. I learnt so much in coding, maths, machine learning and especially trading. Thank you for this intensive time, Gismondi R.! 


Abstract:
This Bachelor thesis evaluates some technical strategies of algorithmic trad- ing and compares those with share price predictions using Deep Neural Net- works. For each strategy, the M3 Company share is used to explain the strat- egy and visualise the performance. Furthermore, for the technical analysis, the daily data of 100 shares of the S&P500 index are used. This ensures solid backtesting to test each strategy extensively.

The result of this thesis is that technical strategies outperformed neural net- work strategies. However, no strategy could reliably outperform the share the strategy was applied on for all results. The best strategy, Double7, out- performed its underlying benchmark 41 of 100 times. The average return a year for that strategy was 17% and for the underlying share 22,5%.

Thus, for long term investing, the buy and hold strategy is preferable. How- ever, for some shares, using a strategy could outperform the underlying share consistently. For that, a deeper examination is needed.
